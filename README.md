# Discourse Youtube Feed Plugin

**Plugin Summary**

Discourse YouTube Feed is a plugin that integrates YouTube content directly into your Discourse forum. It periodically fetches the most recent videos from a specified YouTube channel using the YouTube Data API v3 and stores them in the Discourse PluginStore. The plugin runs a scheduled job twice daily to keep the video list up-to-date, and provides a dedicated page within Discourse to display the latest videos.

The number of videos shown is configurable by the site admin, allowing you to choose how many videos to fetch and display from YouTube. Each video entry includes its title, thumbnail, and publish date for an engaging viewing experience.
